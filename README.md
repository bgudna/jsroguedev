# Vanilla Javascript Roguelike
A destroyed city, you're in a mech. You need to get out!

## current status
playable but all wrong, needs new sprites, and more sprites!

### TODO
- [ ] a complete sprite overhaul, current sprites are temp garbage
- [ ] add movement to characters (animation)
- [ ] add fullscreen option (toggle F)
- [ ] add a proper intro/welcome screen, digital painting
- [ ] add a pause screen (when pressing escape) - show game logo
- [ ] implement a help screen (when pressing "?" or "F1" - function in place, just need the text!)
- [ ] name player option?
- [ ] attribute points distribution
- [ ] implement mouse/touch interactions
- [ ] design a proper UI, showing stats and item names
- [ ] add a town/village/intro area where you can stock up on stuff before entering the death dungeon
- [ ] generate lore?
